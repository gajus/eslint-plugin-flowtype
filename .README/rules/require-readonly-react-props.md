### `require-readonly-react-props`

This rule validates that React props are marked as $ReadOnly. React props are immutable and modifying them could lead to unexpected results. Marking prop shapes as $ReadOnly avoids these issues.

The rule tries its best to work with both class and functional components. For class components, it does a fuzzy check for one of "Component", "PureComponent", "React.Component" and "React.PureComponent". It doesn't actually infer that those identifiers resolve to a proper `React.Component` object.

For example, this will NOT be checked:

```js
import MyReact from 'react';
class Foo extends MyReact.Component { }
```

As a result, you can safely use other classes without getting warnings from this rule:

```js
class MyClass extends MySuperClass { }
```

React's functional components are hard to detect statically. The way it's done here is by searching for JSX within a function. When present, a function is considered a React component:

```js
// this gets checked
type Props = { };
function MyComponent(props: Props) {
    return <p />;
}

// this doesn't get checked since no JSX is present in a function
type Options = { };
function SomeHelper(options: Options) {
    // ...
}

// this doesn't get checked since no JSX is present directly in a function
function helper() { return <p /> }
function MyComponent(props: Props) {
    return helper();
}
```

The rule only works for locally defined props that are marked with a `$ReadOnly` or using covariant notation. It doesn't work with imported props:

```js
// the rule has no way of knowing whether ImportedProps are read-only
import { type ImportedProps } from './somewhere';
class Foo extends React.Component<ImportedProps> { }


// the rule also checks for covariant properties
type Props = {|
    +foo: string
|};
class Bar extends React.Component<Props> { }

// this fails because the object is not fully read-only
type Props = {|
    +foo: string,
    bar: number,
|};
class Bar extends React.Component<Props> { }

// this fails because spreading makes object mutable (as of Flow 0.98)
// https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype/pull/400#issuecomment-489813899
type Props = {|
    +foo: string,
    ...bar,
|};
class Bar extends React.Component<Props> { }
```


```js
{
    "rules": {
        "flowtype/require-readonly-react-props": 2
    }
}
```


Optionally, you can enable support for [implicit exact Flow types](https://medium.com/flow-type/on-the-roadmap-exact-objects-by-default-16b72933c5cf) (useful when using `exact_by_default=true` Flow option):


```js
{
    "rules": {
        "flowtype/require-readonly-react-props": [
            2,
            {
                "useImplicitExactTypes": true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
