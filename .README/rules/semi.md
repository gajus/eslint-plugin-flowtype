### `semi`

_The `--fix` option on the command line automatically fixes problems reported by this rule._

Enforces consistent use of semicolons after type aliases.

This rule takes one argument. If it is `'never'` then a problem is raised when there is a semicolon after a type alias. If it is `'always'` then a problem is raised when there is no semicolon after a type alias.

The default value is `'always'`.
