### `space-before-type-colon`

Enforces consistent spacing before the type annotation colon.

This rule takes one argument. If it is `'always'` then a problem is raised when there is no space before the type annotation colon. If it is `'never'` then a problem is raised when there is a space before the type annotation colon. The default value is `'never'`.
